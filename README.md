# Monte_Carlo_simulation
Monte Carlo simulation for comparing genomic peak files

Notes:

Simple Perl script for comparing peak files from Drosophila genomic data.

Requires .gff file inputs (with the format for chromosomes including "chr" eg. chr2L).

You will need to change the input and output paths in the script.
